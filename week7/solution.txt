# Solution one:

In general, it is not clear which approach is better
– Some experiments indicate stripes win for cooccurrence matrix computation
• Pairs and stripes are special cases of shapes for 
covering the entire matrix
– Could use sub-stripes, or partition matrix horizontally 
and vertically into more square-like shapes etc.
• Can also be applied to higher-dimensional arrays
• Will see interesting version of this idea for joins



# Solution two:

yes
